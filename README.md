# üìä Modern Portfolio Theory ‚Äì Practical Implementation

This project provides a practical implementation of **Modern Portfolio Theory**, combining theoretical rigor with numerical tools that are applicable in real-world portfolio construction and financial analysis.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This project does **not** aim to present any scientific innovation or empirical analysis of portfolio results.  
> Its sole purpose is to offer a practical, modular framework for applying classical portfolio theory, along with examples of how to use it effectively.

## üì¶ Project Structure

The project currently includes three core classes:

### 1. `MeanVarianceOpt`
Performs **Mean-Variance Optimization** as defined in modern finance literature.  
While most academic references focus on analytical solutions, these are often impractical. This class performs **convex numerical optimization** using the `cvxpy` library.

### 2. `CAPM`
A lightweight, high-level utility class for quick analysis based on the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**.  
It provides easy access to key financial ratios (Beta, Sharpe, Treynor) and generates intuitive visualizations to compare asset performance.

### 3. `ModernPortfolio`
An **abstract base class** designed to encapsulate shared attributes and methods.  
This class is **not intended to be used directly**, but serves as the foundation for the two classes above.

## üöÄ Getting Started
### üß∞ Requirements

| Purpose               | Libraries Needed                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Running the classes   | `pandas`, `numpy`, `cvxpy` *(for MeanVarianceOpt only)*                              |
| Running the notebooks | `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`              |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Input Requirements

- All inputs must be `pandas.Series` or `pandas.DataFrame` depending on the class:
  - `MeanVarianceOpt` expects a DataFrame of asset returns.
  - `CAPM` expects a DataFrame of assets and a separate Series for market returns.
- The index must represent dates. If not explicitly a `DatetimeIndex`, the class will attempt to convert it using `pd.to_datetime()`.
- Inputs must contain **daily log-returns**.
- Outputs (e.g., Sharpe, Treynor, expected returns) are automatically converted into **relative returns**, unless stated otherwise.

## üì° Data Source & Usage

The dataset used for testing was retrieved using the `ib_insync` library connected to Interactive Brokers (IB).  
Due to IB‚Äôs licensing policy, **raw market data is excluded** from this repository.
